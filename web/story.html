			Kindred is the white embrace of nothingness and the gnashing of teeth in the dark. Shepherd and the butcher, poet and the primitive, they are one and both. When caught on the edge of life, louder than any trumpeting horn, it is the hammering pulse at one's throat that calls Kindred to their <img src="image/passivesmall.png"> hunt. Stand and greet Lamb's silvered bow and her <img src="image/qsmall.png"> arrows will lay you down swiftly. If you refuse her, Wolf will join you for his merry hunt, where every <img src="image/wsmall.png"> chase runs to its brutal end.

For as long as its people have known death, Kindred has stalked Valoran. When the final moment comes, it is said a true Demacian will turn to Lamb, taking the arrow, while through the shadowed streets of Noxus, Wolf leads the hunt. In the snows of the Freljord, before going off to fight, some warbands 'kiss the Wolf', vowing to honor his chase with the blood of their enemies. After each Harrowing, the town of Bilgewater gathers to celebrate its survivors and honor those granted a true death by Lamb and Wolf.

Denying Kindred is to deny the natural order of things. There are but a wretched few who have eluded these hunters. This perverse escape is no sanctuary, for it only holds a waking nightmare. Kindred waits for those locked in the undeath of the Shadow Isles, for they know all will eventually fall to Lamb's bow or Wolf's teeth.

The earliest dated appearance of the eternal hunters is from a pair of ancient masks, carved by unknown hands into the gravesites of people long-forgotten. But to this day, Lamb and Wolf remain together, and they are always Kindred...

The battle spilled over like a feast before them. Such delicious life - so many to end, so many to hunt! <img src="image/wolfsmall.png"> profileicon Wolf paced in the snow while  <img src="image/lambwolf.png"> profileicon Lamb danced lithely from sword edge to spear tip, the red-blooded butchery never staining her pale coat.

"There is courage and pain here, Wolf. Many will gladly meet their end." She drew up her bow and let loose an arc of swift finality.

The last breath of a soldier came with a ragged consent as his shield gave way to a heavy axe. Stuck in his heart was a single white <img src="image/qsmall.png"> arrow, shimmering with ethereal brilliance.

"Courage bores me" the great black wolf grumbled as he tracked through the snow. "I am hungry and eager to chase."

"Patience" she murmured in his shaggy ear. As soon as the words left her, Wolf's shoulders tensed and his body dropped low to the ground.

"I smell fear" he said, trembling with excitement.

Across the muddied field of snow, a squire - too young for battle, but with blade in hand, nonetheless - saw that Kindred had<img src="image/passivesmall.png"> marked all in the valley.

"I want the tender-thing. Does it see us, Lamb?"

"Yes, but it must choose. Feed the Wolf, or embrace me."

The battle turned its steel toward the squire. He now stared at the roiling tide of bravery and desperation coming for him. This would be his last dawn. In that instant, the boy made his choice. He would not go willingly. Until his last breath, he would run.

Wolf snapped in the air and rolled his face in the snow like a new pup.

"Yes, dear Wolf." Lamb's voice echoed like a string of pearly bells. "Begin your hunt."

With that, Wolf bounded across the field after the youth, a howl thundering through the valley. His shadowed body swept over the remains of the newly dead and their useless, shattered weapons.

The squire turned and ran for the woods until thick black trunks passed in a blur. He pressed on, the frozen air burning his lungs. He looked once more for his hunter, but could see nothing but the darkening trees. The shadows closed tightly around him and he suddenly realized there was no escape. It was the black body of Wolf that was everywhere at once. The chase was at its end. Wolf buried his sharp <img src="image/wsmall.png"> teeth in the squire's neck, tearing out ribbons of vibrant life.

Wolf reveled in the boy's scream and crunching bones. Lamb, who had trailed behind, laughed to see such sport. Wolf turned and asked, in a voice more growl than speech, "Is this music, Lamb?"

"It is to you" she answered.

"Again", Wolf licked the last drop of the youth's life from his canine jaws. "I want to chase again, little Lamb."

"There are always more" she whispered. "Until the day there is only <img src="image/headsmall.png"> Kindred."

"And then will you run from me?"

Lamb turned back to the battle. "I would never run from you, dear Wolf."

	<ins><h3>A Good Death</h3></ins>
		Magga was about to die for the fourteenth time. She had bitten into a rotten apple - yet again. Its putrid flesh had, as always, infected her with carrionshade. The actress went through the motions of stumbling to her death while shouting her final words for all to hear.

"Oh, but how wondrous a dream is life? Only now - too late! - do I wake to see its myriad of splendors", she bemoaned.

With a puff of smoke and glittering powder, <img src="image/headsmall.png"> Kindred made a grand entrance upon the stage. As per tradition, they were played by one actor, his head covered by two opposing masks. He approached Magga, the white mask of the <img src="image/lambsmall.png"> profileicon Lamb facing her.

"Hark! Do I hear a plea for my keenest arrow? Come, child, let the warmth of your heart fade into the cold embrace of oblivion."

Magga refused, as she had thirteen times before. Any nuance in her performance was buried beneath the ear-splitting delivery of her scream. On cue, Lamb spun around, revealing the second mask - that of the Kindred Wolf profileicon Wolf.

"There is naught ye can do to stave off thine end", growled Wolf.

"I am but a poor young maiden! Please, let my piteous cry fall on all four of thine ears."

The audience seemed enraptured by the unfolding dramatics of the 'Orphellum Mechanicals'. With the twin threats of plague and war on the tongues of those in neighboring protectorates, death dramas were all the rage.

Denji, the actor portraying both Lamb and Wolf, descended upon the young actress, awkwardly baring wooden fangs. Magga offered her neck. At the threat of Wolf's bite, she triggered the device sewn into her blouse's collar. Ribbons of red fabric unspooled to the delighted pips and yelps of the audience. They'd gotten what they paid for.<br>
<img src="image/lore1.png"><br>
By the time the Mechanicals had staggered back to their wagon and set off in the direction of Needlebrook, there were no stars to be seen. Instead, a veil of clouds stretched across the night sky.

Needlebrook always delivered a good audience, Illusian, the company's owner and sole dramaturg, explained once more. He staggered around, drunk on his own accolades - as well as the wine Parr had grifted from the locals.

The night wore on, and the troupe had descended into bickering. Tria and Denji lambasted their playwright over the quality of his plots, which fell into a predictable structure: tragedy strikes maiden, death finds maiden, death takes maiden. Illusian argued that complicated plots detracted from a good death scene.

Magga, the youngest of the bunch, agreed with Tria and Denji's diagnosis, but kept her mouth shut. Had she not stowed away in the wandering troupe's wagon, she would certainly be somewhere far more miserable. Luckily for her, the Mechanicals had recently lost several actors due to Illusian's insistence on complete artistic control. Because of his attitude - and obvious mediocrity - they were facing a drought of fresh faces. And so, the 'Orphellum Mechanicals' agreed to contract Magga to die in all their dramatics for the foreseeable future. For which she had been grateful.

Illusian was still smarting from Denji and Tria's words when he motioned to Parr, their wagoner, to stop and make camp. The inebriated auteur set out his bedroll in pride of place next to the wagon. He then threw the rest of the bedding into the long grass nearby.

"Ungrateful players can sleep in the wilds", Illusian spat, "where they shall hopefully find their manners."

The rest of the troupe built a fire and swapped stories. Denji and Tria had fallen asleep in each other's arms while whispering potential names for their unborn child into each other's ears. They had nattered on about the day the traveling company would stop in Jandelle, a town so perfect and peaceful they would set aside their vagabond ways to raise their child.

Magga moved closer to the crackling fire so its pops and whistles would drown out the irksome affections of her traveling companions.

But sleep never came. Instead, Magga tossed and turned, thinking about the looks on the audience's faces as the coiled spurts of blood unfurled from her neckline. A pretty maiden struck dead by her own naïveté was all the theatrical pomp Illusian could muster, but the crowd lusted after the gruesome façade.

Eventually, she left her bedroll and set out into the woods to soothe her unsettled mind.
